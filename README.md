# Oblivion Bot

"Didn't you know that @ImCactus98 didn't do nothing in bot's development? I was the only one working at the bot. I want to give him another chance: if he joins my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/a75eNEAtrt), I can talk to him and clarify some things, for example deleting the repository or giving the proper credits. @ImCactus98 isn't the person you really think, fortunately I'm not his friend anymore."
